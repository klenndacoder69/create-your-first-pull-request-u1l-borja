CMSC 100 U1L

My expectations:
- I hope that mas dumami ang alam ko about web development since I will need this in the future.
- I hope that the instructor passionately teaches us about the course and gives us tips on how to improve fast in this course.
- Lastly, sana I can get a good and passing grade sa course na ito :D
